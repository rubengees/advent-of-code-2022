# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022.

This year, the solutions are written in Kotlin/Native with no third party libraries. I tried to write the solution
quickly instead of with good code quality. So expect missing error handling and hard to read code.

Each day has a `Day.kt` file with the actual solution in `src/nativeMain/kotlin` and a `DayTest.kt` file with the tests
in `src/nativeTest/kotlin`.

The tests can be run with `./gradlew check`.<br/>
All solutions can be run with `./gradlew runReleaseExecutableNative`.
